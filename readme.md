Have some fun with animations!

### Step 3 - Build!

Set clouds_2.gif as the background image. Create a div for the ground/grass with green background and appropriate height - position it at the bottom with position: fixed; or position: absolute;

Create an `<h1>` and display FARM PARTY!. For a bonus, use a fun custom font (like from Google Fonts).
 
For each of the characters you want to animate, via javascript:

- Create an `<img>` for it on the page.
- Position it with position: fixed; or position: absolute; 
- Animate it.
- Do something with it after the animation finishes.

**Be creative!** Add events / clicks and utilize pageX and pageY.
